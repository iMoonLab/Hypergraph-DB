## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-23

### Added
- 📄 HIF (Hypergraph Interchange Format) support: `to_hif()`, `save_as_hif()`, `from_hif()`, `load_from_hif()` (#9)
- 🛠️ Web admin console `hg.admin()` for browsing, searching and editing vertices and hyperedges, with an overview of statistics (#12)
- 🎨 New viewer built on [hypergraph-viz](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hypergraph-viz): hypergraph layout that keeps hyperedge members together, contours around nodes only, labels without overlap, click to highlight a hyperedge, Chinese / English UI (#13)

### Changed
- 📦 The viewer and the admin console load hypergraph-viz and G6 from a CDN; the bundled `g6.min.js` is removed (#13)

### Fixed
- 🐛 `draw()` showed no graph or "Vertex not found" errors when vertex IDs are not strings, e.g. `int` (#10, #11)
- 🔧 Vertices with degree > 50 are no longer pushed to the end of the vertex list (#13)
